# Time To Seconds
Do you want to create a function to convert time to seconds every time you need it? No, right? 

Well, me neither. So I build this easy-to-use function.

You just need to pass a string with the format "h:m:s", "hh:mm:ss", "hhhhhhhhhhh:mmmmmmmm:ssssssssssss" or as many "h"(hours), "m"(minutes) and "s"(seconds) you need.

### Example
```js
timeToSeconds("5:30:20") // 19820
```
